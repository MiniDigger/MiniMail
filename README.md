A mail client, just for me.

- viewing mails

## Local Setup

For convenience, a docker-compose file is provided to run greenmail (mock mail server) and roundcube (an actually good email client):

- Open http://localhost:3001/ in your browser to see roundcube

To start the actual application:

- `Start Dev`
- Open http://localhost:3000/ in your browser to see the app
